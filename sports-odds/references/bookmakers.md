## Sharp vs Square Books

**Sharp books** (Pinnacle, Circa, LowVig):
- Accept large bets
- Move lines based on action
- Generally most accurate odds
- Good benchmark for "true" probability

**Square books** (Most US retail):
- Limit winning bettors
- More promotions/bonuses
- Lines may lag sharp books
- Better for recreational bettors

## Recommended Strategy

1. **Get consensus** — Average odds across major books
2. **Check sharp** — Compare to Pinnacle/LowVig
3. **Find value** — If Polymarket differs from sharp consensus, investigate why
4. **Shop lines** — Different books offer different odds

## Notes

- Not all books cover all sports
- Offshore books (`us2`) have wider coverage
- Some books only offer certain markets (spreads/totals)
- Line movement indicates where sharp money is going
